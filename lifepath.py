# life path number assigns a number to the month you were born in and then adds the numbers from the rest
# and reduces them down to a single digit (unless it's 11 or 22)
# MAY = 5

# DAY = 29
# = 2 + 9 = 11 (no further reduction)

# YEAR = 1981
# = 1 + 9 + 8 + 1 = 19
# = 1 + 9 = 10
# = 1 + 0 = 1

# 5 + 11 + 1 = 17
# 17 = 1 + 7 = 8

# my life path number = 8
